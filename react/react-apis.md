## Launch

* click on this URL ...

## APIs

- Request, response
- ReST w/ examples (e.g. Google search)

## Viewing Data

- Endpoints, parameters, and values
- A few examples to get raw data and to manipulate the request
	- We love Jservice because it's an open API that allows us to spend a fair bit of time JUST messing with the endpoint. I think that fits the bill here as a simple example before ramping up to NYCOpenData
	- fixer.io
- For working with JSON data - see [JSON & Firebase](react/json-firebase.md) mini-unit
- APIs can also write data - see [JSON & Firebase](react/json-firebase.md) mini-unit

## APIs + JavaScript

- AJAX (vanilla JS & jQuery) (name only)
- promises (name only)
- async, await (focus here)
- For visualizing API data - check out the [Victory](react/victory.md) mini-unit

## NYC Open Data APIs

- Documentation
- Peculiarities, difficulties, troubleshooting

> This is both the hardest part of the task I've set before you, Jeffrey, and also the most important.
> 
> If the WHOLE lesson can be focused mostly around this, with an aside to "btw, giphy's api is much easier", that feels right to me.
> 
> If that's not possible, let me know and we can brainstorm scaffolding.

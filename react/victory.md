## Getting Started with Victory

- What is data visualization? Why visualize data? - go check out the lesson on [Data Visualization](./data/visualization.md)
- Briefly mention other data visualization libraries, but we'll focus on:
- Data vis + React = Victory
- Walk through Getting Started: https://formidable.com/open-source/victory/docs

> The real skill here is READING documentation, so to the extent that you can frame this less as "here's how you do thing A in Victory" and more as "Here's how you use documentation to figure out how to do thing A in Victory", we drive closer to the goal of this unit.
>
> Ultimately, I care less about them knowing EVERY feature of how to build a bar chart, or even about understanding how it works under the hood. I just want students to be able to realize how simple-to-use Victory is if they only read documentation.
>
> Students generally have an aversion to reading instructions, and so saying "Go read Victory documentation" doesn't work. But modeling "I want to do something cool, so I'm going to look at Victory documentation to learn how - come along with me for this journey" works really well.

- If screenshots of the docs make sense, great.

## Visual Design

> I'm realizing the more I think about this part, that it's VERY important to me that we model thinking through the visual design here.
>
> So like, it'd be easy to gloss over things like colors and font sizes in favor of showing every bell and whistle Victory has to offer.
>
> Let's prioritize the visual design over the full power of Victory, because I'd rather students know how to make one beautiful data viz, rather than 6 unhelpful / unreadable ones.

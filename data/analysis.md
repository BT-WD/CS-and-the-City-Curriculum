# Data Analysis

## Learning Objectives

* SWBAT examine how to craft questions that data can answer.
* SWBAT relate statistical measurements to determine those answers.
* SWBAT to differentiate between abstract and concrete questions.


### Activities / datasets 
- Titanic dataset:
	- Abstract questions:
		- How did a person's sex impact their odds of survival?
		- How did a person's wealth impact their odds of survival?
	- Concrete questions:
		- How many men between 18-30 years of age survived?
		- What percentage of women under the age 18 survived.

- Conceptual resource around data analysis:
	- [This curriculum](http://www.datapolitan.com/data-driven-gov/#1) from Datapolitan covers a lot of these concepts and has interesting case studies. Slides 26, 262, 267 in particular. May need different examples for kids, but a good starting point. (Elana)

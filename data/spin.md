# Spin: Lab

- spin one way, spin the other, no spin

Library datasets - find a fact in the dataset

[NY Library Dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11cBrFw0EBQWydjKXPY3TXtgnmMyIDhzxxbpAyUs-qR8/edit?usp=sharing) adapted from [librarydatavisual.blogspot.com](http://librarydatavisual.blogspot.com/)

NY has offered $x to libraries - argument for any library as deserving
- which has lost the most books - most irresponsible?
- highest readership, lowest readership

- people tell you what the outcome means before you know what the outcome is

# Data Visualization

## Learning Objectives

* SWBAT consider how and when data visualization can (and must) be used to help communicate information more intelligibly.
* SWBAT differentiate between ethical, unintentionally misleading, and intentionally misleading data visualizations.

## Launch

Let's all copy this spreadsheet: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oIMO0LyJLDOKUmzJl_f_g-ggm-PlijnvoLyubye_mvY/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oIMO0LyJLDOKUmzJl_f_g-ggm-PlijnvoLyubye_mvY/edit?usp=sharing)

1. Describe any similarities or differences you observe between the four datasets.
2. Based on your observations, predict which dataset will have the largest mean value of x and which will have the largest mean value of y.
3. Based on your observations, predict which dataset will have the largest median value of x and which will have the largest median value of y.
4. Based on your observations, predict which dataset will have the largest variance of x and which will have the largest variance of y.
5. For each dataset, calculate the mean of x and the mean of y. Compare your answer to your prediction.
6. For each dataset, calculate the median of x and the median of y. Compare your answer to your prediction.
7. For each dataset, calculate the variance of x and the variance of y. Compare your answer to your prediction.
8. Calculate the equation for the linear regression (line of best fit) for each dataset. What do you notice?
9. Taking into account your predictions and your calculations, how might you compare the datasets to one another?
10. Can you create a fifth dataset that follows the pattern you've observed so far?

### Activities / datasets

- Election maps
- 52% v 48% bar charts
- [Bad/Misleading visualizations](https://simplystatistics.org/2012/11/26/the-statisticians-at-fox-news-use-classic-and-novel-graphical-techniques-to-lead-with-data/)
- I like slide 19 of [this presentation](http://complexdiagrams.com/4pillars) - making the point that visualizations should be focused on answering a question-not just data itself
- Some examples from Noel's twitter. (?)

# Finding Data: Lab

## Data Sources

Choose one of the following data sources:

- [NYC Open Datasets](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/)
- [New York State Open Data](https://data.ny.gov/)
- [Unites States Open Data](https://www.data.gov)
- [United Nations Open Data](http://data.un.org/)

Take a few minutes to explore the data source you selected.

For the data source you chose:

1. Why did you choose that data source to explore?
2. What sorts of data does the source provide?
3. Where does this data come from?
4. How difficult is it to find the raw data?
5. Describe the data source's description of the datasets: was there enough information to indicate what data you should expect to see?
6. In what format(s) can you access the raw data?
7. And a few more questions that get progressively more in depth.

Once you've explored one data source, choose a different data source to compare to the first:

1. A bunch of comparison questions.

Take a few minutes to explore one or more of the other data sources listed above.

1. What are the characteristics of a useful data source?
2. Some other synthesis questions.

## Intro

You may remember from previous math classes where you've been taught how to calculate the mean, median, and mode of a set of numbers. The focus of this lesson is not on the mathematics of how to do those calculations (and others), but instead on what those numbers represent. This less will give you a better understanding of how useful statistical measurements can be and how to ask whether or not they're the right way to summarize a set of data. 

## Mean, Median, Mode

#### Review on calculations

Recall how to calculate these statistical values:

- Mean (also called the average): to calculate the mean, we add up all of the values in a set of data and then divide by the number of values in the set.
- Median: to calculate the median, we arrange all of the values in increasing order and count to the middle number.
- Mode: to calculate the mode, we arrange all of the values in increasing order and identify which value occurs most often.

#### Example

Consider a dataset of exam scores: [100, 86, 90, 93, 75, 40, 66, 98, 90, 79, 88]

- The mean is: (100 + 86 + 90 + 93 + 75 + 40 + 66 + 98 + 90 + 79 + 88)/11 = (905)/11 = 82.27
- Rearranging the values in increasing order: [40, 66, 75, 79, 86, 88, 90, 90, 93, 98, 100]
	- There are 11 total values, so the median is the 6th value: 86
	- The mode is the value that occurs most often: 90

Think about why computers are particularly good at calculating the mean, median, and mode. Could you write a function that would calculate each statistical measurement?

### Understanding Distributions

You've probably been able to calculate the mean, median, and mode of a set of values using your calculator or even a computer, but what happens when the number of values in the data set goes from 11 (above) to 11 million? Do you think these statistical measurements are as meaningful?

Instead of boiling down 11 million numbers to one of these three statistical values, data scientists will often instead prefer to look at the distribution of the values to get a better sense of the data. Distributions are difficult to calculate by hand, but they are a graphical way to know whether the values in a data set are evenly spread around some central value, whether there are more greater values or lesser values (whether the data is skewed), or even whether the data is composed of multiple features that might be grouped around particular values. Distributions can take the form of column (bar) charts or line charts; column charts are used when there is a relatively small number of possible discrete values in the dataset, and line charts either to approximate many many more discrete values or when the data is continuous.

(Something about the mean (symmetrical, is middle. asymmetrical, pushed to "heavier" side), median (based on the counts, can be same as mean in symmetrical, weighted more toward peak in asymmetrical), and mode (highest point) in a visual context of a distribution)

Consider the distributions below:

![Normal Distribution]()

![Boltzmann Distribution]()

![Bimodal Distribution]()

![Random Distribution]()

- What is the mode of each dataset?
- What is the mean of each dataset?
- What is the median of each dataset?

These three are useful, but need more --> variance.

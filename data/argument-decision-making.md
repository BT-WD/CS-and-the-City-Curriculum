## Intro to Data Science

### What is "Data Science"?

If you've been tuned into the news, the job market, or even just looking at ads on the subway recently, you've probably come across the term "data science". Colleges and universities are offering degrees in data science, businesses are using data science to out-perform each other, and even the government at all levels (borough, city, state, federal, international) is using data science to make data-driven decisions.

But what is "data science"?

**Data science** is an umbrella term that draws upon a number of fields including mathematics, statistics, computer science, and even sociology, journalism, and design. Depending on how the term is being used, it could mean anything from statistics to machine learning and artificial intelligence.

What distinguishes the different meanings of "data science" is really a question of what you're trying to do with data:

- Are you trying to better understand the data that you have? (That's **analytics**.)
- Are you trying to make decisions based upon the data you have? (That's probably **statistics**.)
- Do you have a lot of complex data and are trying to make sense of it? (That's **machine learning**.)

Data science as a field is put into practice depending on what you want to do with data:

- **Description**: You want to understand the data you have. _e.g. Subway trains arrive late to the station 24% of the time._
- **Prediction**: You want to guess what's going to happen in the future. _e.g. Next week, ridership will increase across the subway system by 9%._
- **Prescription**: You want to say what should be done as a result of your prediction about the future. _e.g. In order to meet the anticipated increase in demand, the MTA should add 3 trains per line per hour from 7am to 7pm._

#### Optional Activity: Three Questions

Think about something you do most days. Maybe you ride the subway, maybe you go shopping, maybe you check social media, maybe you spend time with your family, maybe you go to the movies. See if you can come up with three questions you could investigate about that activity:

* The first question should be **descriptive** - the answer to this question should just describe the activity. _e.g. What percentage of my time do I spend playing video games every week?_
* The second question should be **predictive** - the answer to this question is related to some future state of the activity. _e.g. How much time can I expect to spend playing games next month?_
* The third question should be **prescriptive** - the answer to this question should recommend an action based on the answer to a prediction. _e.g. What other activities should I do instead of playing video games so often?_

### Data vs. Information

When you've talked about data in the past, you may have used the words **data** and **information** interchangeably. Although they are quite similar, these two words have an important distinction:

- **Data** is comprised of the raw measurements, observations, or responses that would be collected from tools like feedback surveys, mechanical sensors, or even digital logs. Data can also be simple facts and figures that result from those raw measurements.
- **Information** is data that has been processed, interpreted, organized, structured or presented in a way that makes the data meaningful or useful. Information carries with it a point-of-view or an opinion because a human has made decisions about its meaning.

In addition to **data** and **information**, the term **insight** often accompanies a discussion about data. **Insight** is the understanding we get from data and information and usually relates to the decision-making capabilities that result from processing data into information.

### Open Data

When you think about all of the data that exists in the world, you might start to realize that you cannot access most of it. In fact, businesses, governments, and even people keep a lot of the data they have private in order to secure a competitive advantage over other businesses, governments, and people. In the last decade, however, there has been a movement to make data more available instead of locking it down. This movement is called the Open Data Movement.

**Open data** is data that has been collected by businesses, governments or people that is shared freely on the Internet. This data could comprise anything: restaurant reviews, geolocation data, census data, 411 calls, property values, government budget data, etc. But why would governments be sharing data for anyone to take and use?

Increasingly, governments have recognized the fact that their authority and power is drawn from the people, and unlike businesses which might argue that exclusive access to their data would lead to increased profit, governments are arguing that opening access to their data is leading to increased civic engagement, improved public works, and additional accountability.

#### A Simple Case Study

Let's compare the MTA in New York City and a transit authority in some other city.

In the other city, the transit authority restricts access to their train arrival time data and budgets $20,000 to build an app for users to see when trains will arrive at the station. That transit authority doesn't know how to build apps; they know how to drive trains. So instead of only spending $20,000, their app goes over-budget by $15,000; it then underperforms with users, and the agency doesn't have any additional funds to spend to make it better.

In New York City, however, the transit authority recognizes that they're pretty good at driving trains, but not so great at making apps. The MTA instead spends $10,000 to build a system that shares train arrival data with developers. This open data is then taken by developers who compete for a $5,000 prize to whomever can build the best app with that data. The MTA receives more than 50 app submissions, and the public gets to choose which app is the best and should get the money. The developers of the winning app choose to build a business from their app, and they go on to develop apps for other cities as well. The MTA spent $15,000, didn't go over-budget, and got loads of great apps just by opening up their data and making it available for developers to use.

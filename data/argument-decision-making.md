Below is an excerpt from ["'Forced busing' didn't fail. Desegregation is the best way to improve our schools."](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/10/23/forced-busing-didnt-fail-desegregation-is-the-best-way-to-improve-our-schools/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.b7ef44272407) published in _The Washington Post_ on October 23, 2015.

Before reading the excerpt:

- Based on the title, what argument do you think the author is going to make?
- Based on the title, what data do you think the author will use to support his point?
- Based on the subtitle - "Racial achievement gaps were narrowest at the height of school integration." - what issue(s) do you think the author perceives are problematic today?

Consider the following excerpt:

> Two miles from my office in Syracuse, N.Y., Westside Academy Middle School has been in need of repairs for decades. Located in one of the nation's poorest census tracts, 85 percent of its students are black or Latino, and 86 percent are poor enough to qualify for free or reduced-price lunches. The 400 students have limited creative outlets, with no orchestra or band and just two music teachers.
>
> Ten miles away, Wellwood Middle School, in a suburban district, offers students a stately auditorium and well-equipped technology rooms. There, 88 percent of the students are white and only 10 percent qualify for free or reduced-price lunch. The 700 students have at least five music teachers, band, orchestra, choir, musical theater and dozens of other clubs and activities.
>
> Fifty percent of Wellwood’s eighth graders passed the state math assessment. At Westside, none did. The disparate student outcomes are no surprise.

- What data is used by the author to make his point?
- Do you think the data presented is fair and accurate?
- Based on this excerpt, what does the author want you to think about the state of segregation in schools?

The author continues:

> ["This American Life"] noted that, despite declarations that busing to desegregate schools failed in the 1970s and 1980s, that era actually saw significant improvement in educational equity. When the National Assessment of Educational Progress began in the early 1970s, there was a 53-point gap in reading scores between black and white 17-year-olds. That chasm narrowed to 20 points by 1988. During that time, every region of the country except the Northeast saw steady gains in school integration. In the South in 1968, 78 percent of black children attended schools with almost exclusively minority students; by 1988, only 24 percent did. In the West during that period, the figure declined from 51 percent to 29 percent.
> 
> But since 1988, when education policy shifted away from desegregation efforts, the reading test score gap has grown — to 26 points in 2012 — with segregated schooling increasing in every region of the country.

### Data vs. Information

When you've talked about data in the past, you may have used the words **data** and **information** interchangeably. Although they are quite similar, these two words have an important distinction:

- **Data** is comprised of the raw measurements, observations, or responses that would be collected from tools like feedback surveys, mechanical sensors, or even digital logs. Data can also be simple facts and figures that result from those raw measurements.
- **Information** is data that has been processed, interpreted, organized, structured or presented in a way that makes the data meaningful or useful. Information carries with it a point-of-view or an opinion because a human has made decisions about its meaning.

In addition to **data** and **information**, the term **insight** often accompanies a discussion about data. **Insight** is the understanding we get from data and information and usually relates to the decision-making capabilities that result from processing data into information.

- Look back at the excerpts above. Make a list of the data, information, and insight included by the author to make his point.

| Data | Information | Insight |
| --- | --- | ---|
| e.g. 400 students at Westside | e.g. 85% of Westside students are black | e.g. Westside is a disadvantaged school |

## The Misuse of Data

Data does not exist in a neutral vacuum. Throughout history, data has been used both positively and negatively. At its worst, data has been a justification for discrimination ([GI Bill and black WWII veterans](https://www.history.com/news/gi-bill-black-wwii-veterans-benefits)), a means by which to forcibly separate people ([WWII internment of Japanese Americans](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/retropolis/wp/2018/04/03/secret-use-of-census-info-helped-send-japanese-americans-to-internment-camps-in-wwii/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.f5e994f73a5d)), and a basis for all sorts of racist, sexist, xenophobic, and classist ills. Still today we see data being used to justify humanitarian crises around the world.

The [intentional disregard of data](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/unauthorized-immigrants-are-overwhelmingly-law-abiding-but-it-wont-stop-trump/2019/06/02/5f4f696a-8193-11e9-bce7-40b4105f7ca0_story.html) poses a threat equal to the use of data for nefarious purposes, especially when that disregard is coupled with political or business interests. Perhaps the critical issue of our time where data has been misused by being _unused_ is climate change. Despite scientific consensus about the correlation between atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration and global temperature, politicians continue to ignore and deny the data, its interpretation, and its effects upon our planet.

#### How can data be misused?

Below are several ways data can be (or has been) misused. Can you think of any others?

- Data can be ignored. (see climate change example above)
- Data can be selectively filtered to support an argument. By not including all available data, a conclusion can be skewed in favor of a pre-determined outcome.
- Data can be used to round up, segregate, or otherwise disenfranchise a group of people. Census data is often cited as a means by which the government can assert control over specific sub-groups of the population.
- Data can be mis-interpreted. Too often the public lacks the skills to interpret data for themselves, so people accept the interpretation they are provided.
- Data can be used to violate privacy. Even though data providers claim data has been anonymized, sometimes there is still enough to find out exactly who someone is.

#### A Simple Case Study

Imagine a bank that is trying to decide whether or not to give someone a loan. In addition to deciding whether or not to grant a loan, the bank can also set the interest rate at which the customer should pay back the loan.

In order to make the loan application easier, the bank has made an app for smart phones through which the application is filled out. Once the app has been installed on a user's phone, the app also requests access to the user's music libraries (iTunes, Spotify, Pandora, etc.). The bank knows that most users will not read the fine print in the Terms & Conditions of their app, and since most users will just want to get a loan, they'll agree to whatever the bank wants them to.

**Can you think of ways data about a user's music listening might impact the decisions a bank would make about a loan?** Take a moment to brainstorm with a partner.

Do you think the bank could tell what sex, race, or class a user is just by the music they listen to? Maybe they would think the user is _probably_ Dominican if they listen to bachata; maybe they would think the user is _probably_ black if they listen to particular artists; maybe they would think the user is _probably_ wealthy if they listen to a lot of classical music. Accessing a user's music listening history might indicate information about the user that the bank couldn't otherwise ask in order to discriminate against loan applicants.

- What other data exists on your phone that might be misused to violate your privacy?

### "Fake News"

The rise of partisan journalism has led to claims of "fake news" throughout the socio-political spectrum. "Fake news" has permeated elections, has destroyed careers, and is too-often used to deny any story someone disagrees with, whether the story is based in fact or not. But in reality, "fake news" is a symptom of the metrics by which **user engagement** is measured: clicks, views, and shares.

As information has become commoditized, the techniques used by content-providers, marketers, and media outlets have been co-opted to guide users to tantalizingly wrong information. The headline writing style made popular by websites like Upworthy - "You're not going to believe what happened next..." - which, once recognized as immensely effective at driving people to click and engage, was then used to sensationalize and polarize people's beliefs.

### Optional Activity: Identifying "Fake News"

How can you distinguish real news from "fake news"?

Take a few minutes to consider how you can tell whether a news story is real or "fake". Write down at least 5 questions you would use to interrogate any news story and how the answers to those questions might lead you to label the story as real or "fake".

Find a news article online from a satirical news outlet such as [The Onion](https://www.theonion.com/), [The Daily Mash](https://www.thedailymash.co.uk/), [The Borowitz Report](https://www.newyorker.com/humor/borowitz-report), [Private Eye](https://www.private-eye.co.uk/), or [ClickHole](https://www.clickhole.com/).

Use your 5 questions to decide whether the news story is real or "fake". How well did your questions do at identifying "fake news"?

## Data Literacy

As you continue to grapple with distinguishing real news from "fake news", you'll realize that you're building an intuition for how to read and understand data. That data might be numerical, but it also might be textual, contextual, or even visual. The ability to digest and synthesize information is core to what is known as "data literacy". Data literacy also includes the ability to critique data and information as well as a visual acuity to interpret data-based graphics such as data visualizations.

### Activity: Types of Data

See how many types of data you can brainstorm in 5 minutes. For each type, also consider potential sources of that data.

_For example, geographic data might come from satellites, from locations of users on their smartphones, from city zoning data, etc._

> Note: Think broadly! Try to consider various types of quantitative (numerical), qualitiative (textual), and alternative (images, video, sound, etc.) data. You might also think about less traditional sources of data like anecdotal data, case studies, and/or aggregate data.

## Close

We've seen a lot about how data is all around us and how that data can be used and misused. Next time we'll dig into how bias affects data science:

- decisions about what data we collect
- interpretation of data and information creation
- communication of analytical results
- possible actions to take resulting from analysis

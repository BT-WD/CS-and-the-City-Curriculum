# Bias

## Learning Objectives

* SWBAT examine the ways in which data can be misused in presentation and analysis.
* SWBAT critique the intentional misuse of data.
* SWBAT recognize the unintentional misuse of data.

## Launch

Show a spurious correlation w/ numbers to prove it.

## Types of Bias in Data Science

1. Confirmation bias - when you want to prove a pre-determined conclusion.
2. Selection bias - when you subjectively use data that supports the point you want to make.
3. Outliers - if a dataset has extreme outliers, average values can be skewed.
4. Overfitting (and underfitting) - making an overly-complicated (or overly-simplistic) model to represent the data.
5. Confounding variables - there's something missing from the dataset that influences both the independent and dependent variables, but which causes you to assume a cause-and-effect relationship.
6. Correlation is not causation - just because two things follow the same trend doesn't necessarily mean one causes the other. [can also show spurious correlation]

## Case Study 1: Bias in Reporting

The following two passages were written about the _____ in the 19##'s

<table>
	<tr>
		<td>Passage A</td>
		<td>Passage B</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
			<h1>Police officer charged in shooting death of unarmed neighbor</h1>
			<h3>Dallas police officer Amber Guyger says she entered Botham Shem Jean's apartment by mistake at end of her shift; Casey Stegall reports.</h3>
		</td>
		<td>
			<h1>Dallas police officer charged with manslaughter in fatal shooting of unarmed man in his own apartment</h1>
			<h3>A Dallas police officer was arrested Sunday in connection with the shooting death of Botham Shem Jean, the Texas Rangers said. Amber Guyger, who is white, was off-duty when she shot Jean, a black man, after mistakenly entering his apartment at the complex where she also lived, police said Thursday.</h3>

### Discussion Questions

- How would you describe each author's intent for writing their passage?
- How is each author using their language to impact the reader's response?
- JOLSON TO ADD GUIDING QUESTION(S)

The comparison you've just made is what people think about when they think about biased reporting. Unfortunately, the biases with which we analyze data can also lead to differences in interpretation.

## Case Study 2: Bias in Interpretation

The following two passages are news articles covering a recent report by the _____. (same statistic/survey/data/information: two separate interpretations of the same data, selective about what to include/framing/interpretation)

| Passage A | Passage B |
| :--- | :--- |
| Some text here | Some text here |

### Discussion Questions

- How do the authors' interpretations of the report differ?
- Where do you think that difference comes from?
- JOLSON TO ADD GUIDING QUESTION(S)

Sometimes people interpret data differently, and that can be ok. However, if those interpretations don't also recognize the effects of inherent biases, the reader is required to make a critique of the biases which might be affecting how an author has come to their conclusions.

## Case Study 3: Bias in Visualization

Consider the three sets of data visualizations below. Each set represents the same information:

| Visualization A | Visualization B |
| :---: | :---: |
| ![Interest Rates](./images/zbl-3.png) | ![Interest Rates](./images/zbl-4.png) |

| Visualization A | Visualization B |
| :---: | :---: |
| ![Election Map](./images/election-map-0.png) | ![Election Map](./images/election-map-1.jpg) |

| Visualization A | Visualization B |
| :---: | :---: |
| ![Gun Deaths](./images/gun-deaths-0.jpg) | ![Gun Deaths](./images/gun-deaths-1.jpg) |


### Discussion Questions

- Why did the person making each of these graphs choose to represent the data the way they have?
- What message do you think that person was trying to communicate by making those choices?
- Which do you think is more biased? more unbiased?
- JOLSON TO ADD GUIDING QUESTION(S)

## Close

Bias is complicated. It can be intentional or unintentional; it can be hidden or it can be overt. Bias is usually dangerous and harmful, but it can be incredibly difficult to get away from our own biases. Bias can be a weapon to accomplish specific ends, and bias can cause us to think narrowly.

- What are your biases?
- How can you ensure that your biases don't affect your interpretation of data?

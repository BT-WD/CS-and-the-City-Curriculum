## Types of Bias in Data Science

*Bias* means believing what you want to believe and refusing to take into consideration the opinions of others. In data science, bias can manifest in a few ways:

1. *Confirmation bias* is when you want to prove a pre-determined conclusion.
2. *Selection bias* is when you subjectively use data that supports the point you want to make.
3. *Outliers* - if a dataset has extreme outliers, average values can be skewed.
4. *Overfitting (and underfitting)* can lead to an overly-complicated (or overly-simplistic) model to represent the data.
5. *Confounding variables* is when there's something missing from the dataset that influences both the independent and dependent variables, but which causes you to assume a cause-and-effect relationship.
6. *Correlation is not causation.* Just because two things follow the same trend doesn't necessarily mean one causes the other. [can also show spurious correlation]

## Case Study 1: Bias in Reporting

The following two headlines and subheads were written by two different news outlets about a 2018 shooting death in Dallas, TX.

| Headline A |
| --- |
| <h3>Police officer charged in shooting death of unarmed neighbor</h3><h5>Dallas police officer Amber Guyger says she entered Botham Shem Jean's apartment by mistake at end of her shift; Casey Stegall reports.</h5> |

| Headline B |
| --- |
| <h3>Dallas police officer charged with manslaughter in fatal shooting of unarmed man in his own apartment</h3><h5>A Dallas police officer was arrested Sunday in connection with the shooting death of Botham Shem Jean, the Texas Rangers said.</h5><h5>Amber Guyger, who is white, was off-duty when she shot Jean, a black man, after mistakenly entering his apartment at the complex where she also lived, police said Thursday.</h5> |

### Discussion Questions

- How would you describe each author's intent for writing their headline and subhead?
- How is each author using their language to impact the reader's response?
- What data is each author including or not including that might impact the reader's response?

The comparison you've just made is what people think about when they think about biased reporting. Unfortunately, the biases with which we analyze data can also lead to differences in interpretation.

## Case Study 2: Bias in Interpretation

When we interpret data, we can "spin" data in quite a few ways:
> Many people will be familiar with the concept of "spin"; in popular culture, spin is "a form of propaganda to influence public opinion" (Esquire 1996;126:70), more specifically "the manipulation of language to convince the reader of the likely truth of the result." (BMJ 1995;310:985â€“7)

1. *Confirmation bias* is evaluating evidence that supports one's preconceptions differently from evidence that challenges these convictions
2. *Rescue bias* is discounting data by finding selective faults in the experiment
3. *Auxiliary hypothesis bias* is introducing ad hoc modifications to imply that an unanticipated finding would have been otherwise had the experimental conditions been different
4. *Mechanism bias* is being less skeptical when underlying science furnishes credibility for the data
5. *"Time will tell" bias* is the phenomenon that different scientists need different amounts of confirmatory evidence
6. *Orientation bias* is the possibility that the hypothesis itself introduces prejudices and errors and becomes a determinate of experimental outcomes

The following two passages are news articles covering a recent report by the _____. (same statistic/survey/data/information: two separate interpretations of the same data, selective about what to include/framing/interpretation)

| Passage A | Passage B |
| :--- | :--- |
| Some text here | Some text here |

### Discussion Questions

- How do the authors' interpretations of the report differ?
- Where do you think that difference comes from?
- JOLSON TO ADD GUIDING QUESTION(S)

Sometimes people interpret data differently, and that can be ok. However, if those interpretations don't also recognize the effects of inherent biases, the reader is required to make a critique of the biases which might be affecting how an author has come to their conclusions.

## Case Study 3: Bias in Visualization

Consider the three sets of data visualizations below. Each pair represents the same information:

| Visualization A | Visualization B |
| :---: | :---: |
| ![Interest Rates](./images/zbl-3.png) | ![Interest Rates](./images/zbl-4.png) |

| Visualization A | Visualization B |
| :---: | :---: |
| ![Election Map](./images/election-map-0.png) | ![Election Map](./images/election-map-1.jpg) |

| Visualization A | Visualization B |
| :---: | :---: |
| ![Gun Deaths](./images/gun-deaths-0.jpg) | ![Gun Deaths](./images/gun-deaths-1.jpg) |

### Discussion Questions

- Why did the person making each of these graphs choose to represent the data the way they have?
- What message do you think that person was trying to communicate by making those choices?
- Which do you think is more biased? more unbiased?
- JOLSON TO ADD GUIDING QUESTION(S)

## Close

Bias is complicated. It can be intentional or unintentional; it can be hidden or it can be overt. Bias is usually dangerous and harmful, but it can be incredibly difficult to get away from our own biases. Bias can be a weapon to accomplish specific ends, and bias can cause us to think narrowly.

- What are your biases?
- How can you ensure that your biases don't affect your interpretation of data?

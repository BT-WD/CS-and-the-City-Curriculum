# Segmenting & Pivot Tables

## Learning Objectives

* SWBAT sort data.
* SWBAT filter data.
* SWBAT aggregate data in a PivotTable.
* SWBAT manipulate data.
* SWBAT craft questions that data can answer.

In this lab, we'll explore a dataset of every Olympic athlete (Summer and Winter Games) since the 1896 Olympic Games in Athens. Make a copy of the [Olympic Athletes Dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Q2iJtAOdec18Ufh_2lcvOLHSl37rDKOFfU5i4n1odqw/edit?usp=sharing), and begin by exploring the data.

1. Make a prediction about the following:
- What country has won the most Olympic medals in history?
- In what year did the greatest number of athletes participate in the Olympics?
- Which has more events: the Summer or the Winter Olympics?

2. Based on your exploration of the dataset, come up with three original questions you could ask of this dataset.
> e.g. How many gold medalists has Bulgaria produced?
> e.g. How many athletes from the United States have been in the Olympics?
> e.g. What is the average weight of all silver medalists in the 1988 Winter Olympics?

## Sorting Data

Some questions can be answered simply by sorting data. For instance:

- Who is the heaviest Olympic athelete ever, and what is their weight? Who is the lightest, and what is their weight?
- Who is the oldest Olympic athlete ever, and what is their age? Who is the youngest, and what is their age?
- Who is the tallest Olympic athlete ever, and what is their height? Who is the shortest, and what is their height?

Answer these questions by sorting the worksheet by the correct column. To sort, click on the down arrow in the column header, then choose `Sort sheet A → Z` for descending order or `Sort sheet Z → A` for ascending order:

![Choose how to sort the sheet](./images/sort-2.png)

Questions that can be answered by sorting don't require any complex filtering or aggregation of data; the data is already in the right format and we simply want to see what's on the top or bottom of a sorted list.

> You can always reset the sheet to its original sort by sorting on the `ID` field.

## Filtering Data

To answer some questions you want to filter out data and only show (or not show) certain things. Filtering can be used in combination with sorting to answer slightly more complex questions:

- Who is the oldest Olympic athlete from Canada, and how old were they when they competed?
- What event(s) did the first South African Olympian(s) participate in?
- Who won the gold, silver, and bronze medals in the Rowing Men's Coxed Eights in the 1964 Summer Olympics?

To filter data, we have to turn on filters for the entire table. Select the entire table by clicking in the top-left-most box (to the left of Column A), and then select `Data > Create a filter` or the filter icon: ![Filter icon](./images/filter.png)
